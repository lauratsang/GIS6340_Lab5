I used line.strip to remove\n# any leading or trailing whitespaces so that it is only counting the characters in the\n# word. Then, I used an if statement to only print words that are greater than 19 characters\n# in length.\n\n# 9.2 Write a function called has_no_e that returns True if the given word doesn’t have the\n# letter “e” in it.\n\ndef has_no_e(word):\n    for letter in word:\n        if letter == 'e':\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# For this exercise, you can enter a word then the program will tell you if that word has an\n# \"e.\" If the letter e is in it, the function will return True.\n\ndef has_no_e_2():\n    fin = open(\"words.txt\")\n    word_count = 0\n    count = 0\n    for line in fin:\n        word_count = word_count + 1\n        words = line.strip()\n        if words.find(\"e\") == -1:\n            print(words)\n            count = count + 1\n    percent_of_words = (count/word_count) * 100\n    print(\"Percent:\", percent_of_words)\n\n# This exercise was trickier to figure out because I didn't think to make a count loop to \n# figure out the word percentage at first. I was planning on counting all the words using \n# a word counter on Microsoft word but then I found a solution online that used the counter\n# that I thought was smart. Once I figured out the word count part, the rest was very similar\n# to the previous exercise. The percent of words without an e is 5.32%\n\n# 10.1 Write a function called nested_sum that takes a list of lists of integers and adds up\n# the elements from all of the nested lists.\n\nt = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]\n\ndef nested_sum():\n    total = 0\n    for x in t:\n        total += sum(x)\n    return total\n        \n# This exercise was pretty straightforward because I just added all the elements up.\n\n# 10.2 Write a function called cumsum that takes a list of numbers and returns the cumulative\n# sum; that is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the first i + 1 elements from the\n# original list.\n\ndef cumsum(t):\n    total = 0\n    res = []\n    for x in t:\n        total += x\n        res.append(total)\n    return res\n\n# This function was pretty straightforward once I figured out to append the total to a \n# new list.\n\n",
