# GIS6340 Lab 5
The labs this week were more difficult compared to the past weeks. I struggled with some of the ThinkPython examples in Part 1 and it took a while for me to set up GeoPandas and connect it to Jupyter notebook. In part 2, I struggled with loading the file into Jupyter notebook because the file path navigated to my account directory but I had saved the data into my documents folder which was uploaded onto iCloud which made things complicated. However, I was able to figure it out in the end. I thought this week's work was very important and I appreciate the fact that we were assigned to install GeoPandas because we will be able to use it past the duration of this class. In Part 1, we learned about how to read through lists and created programs to practice loops and recursion. In part 2, we used pandas and geopandas to read a shapefile and create a plot. I can definitely see how part 2 will be used throughout this course and I am curious to learn more about ways to integrate python with GIS.
